## Background

This is a minor release.  The only change is a correction to the index entry for one of the package vignettes that wrongly duplicated the index entry for a different vignette.
This change is in response to the recent change to R CMD checks on CRAN that now reports duplicated index entries.

This package is written entirely in R with no external dependencies/components other than the packages listed in the DESCRIPTION file.
Development approach is aligned with practices described in:
http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
