basictabler 0.1.1.9000
================

Breaking Changes
----------------

* The default value of the `specifyCellsAsList` argument in the `tbl$getCells()` function has been changed to `TRUE` (previously `FALSE`) since this argument usage is more intuative and is consistent with the `pt$getCells()` function in the `pivottabler` package. 

Improvements
----------------

* Ability to merge table cells.  See the "Working with Cells" vignette for an example.
* Specifying the styling/formatting of individual cells/groups of cells is now simpler using the `tbl$setStyling()` function.  See the "Styling" vignette and the "Finding and Formatting" vignette for more details and examples. 
* Ability to specify styling when creating tables.  See the "Styling" vignette for more details. 
* A more detailed explanation of styling rules has been added to the "Styling" vignette.
